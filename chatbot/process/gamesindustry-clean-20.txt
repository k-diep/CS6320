After two years of praise and popularity on PC and consoles, Stardew Valley dug into mobile last month with an iOS launch, and it appears to have been a reasonably successful one for the premium farming sim. Sensor Tower reports that Stardew Valley has grossed over $1 million on iOS since its launch on the platform three weeks ago today. It's worth noting that the game is a premium game costing $7.99 and does not have any microtransactions. Around 41% of those who purchased the game on mobile were based in the US. Japanese users made up 12%. In addition, nearly one-fourth of the game's players on iOS were playing on iPad rather than iPhone.
