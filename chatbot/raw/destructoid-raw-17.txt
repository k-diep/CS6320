Indie publisher Chucklefish has proudly announced the launch of agricultural life sim Stardew Valley on iOS. A new trailer showcases the new edition of the popular game, which bears more than a passing resemblance to the beloved Harvest Moon series. For those who haven’t had the opportunity, The game has players step into the shoes of a customisable character, who arrives in the titular Stardew Valley and begins to cultivate a thriving farming business. Growing crops, rearing animals, going to market and keeping troublesome predators at bay (not the one from the Schwarzenegger movie). Alongside these daily chores, players can go fishing, meet the townsfolk, and even settle down with a partner. For those more daring, there are dungeons to be explored and treasures to be unearthed. Things escalate pretty quickly from planting carrots… Already available on PS4, PC, Xbox One, Switch and PS Vita, Stardew Valley is now available on iOS devices, with an Android version to follow in the near future.
