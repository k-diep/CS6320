Stardew Valley has sold over a million copies, publisher Chucklefish Games confirmed to Polygon. That makes the farming simulator one of Steam's biggest releases of 2016 thus far, according to SteamSpy. "It's actually at 1,007,000 [copies sold] as of now," a representative for Chucklefish Games told Polygon in an email. That figure has yet to be reflected on SteamSpy, a third-party tracking platform that keeps tabs on how games on Steam are selling. Based on the updated number, its list of 2016's biggest commercial hits finds Stardew Valley sitting just under the free-to-play Ark: Survival of the Fittest and H1Z1, whose sales numbers comprise both free and paid versions. Stardew Valley ranks among Steam's top paid releases of 2016 thus far. The indie game, produced by a single developer, hit the marketplace on Feb. 26, following years of beta releases and updates. It neared half a million copies sold in March, after two weeks on sale. "It's been really exciting for us to help bring this game to people's attention," the Chucklefish representative said, "and the success really couldn't have come to a more deserving person!" Eric Barone, Stardew Valley's creator, hasn't commented on the game's recent milestone. He's continued to update the game since its February release; the latest build offers several changes meant to improve the quality of married life in Stardew Valley, as well as reducing the effects of dying in a mine. The game is currently limited to Windows PC. Barone is currently in talks to bring the game to consoles, according to MCVUK.
